# Millennium Falcon ANSI parallax animation

![Animated Millennium Falcon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kirkman/sw-milfalcon/master/output/milfalcon6.gif)

This ANSI art animation was released in the [Blocktronics](http://www.blocktronics.org) ["Detention Block AA-23"](http://www.blocktronics.org/downloads/artpacks/blocktronics_detention_block_aa-23.zip) artpack. Artwork and code by Kirkman (Josh Renaud).

If you'd like to read about the creation of this animation, read my 2017 blog post ["New parallax ANSImation: Millennium Falcon dodging asteroids"](http://breakintochat.com/blog/2017/05/25/new-parallax-ansimation-millennium-falcon-dodging-asteroids/).

This animation runs in [Synchronet BBS](http://www.synchro.net) software's Javascript environment, and requires its Frame.js and Sprite.js libraries.

You can also download [the animation in ANS format](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kirkman/sw-milfalcon/master/output/KM-FALC.ANS).

(The code in this repository and the animated GIF above fix a couple small rendering bugs that were present in the artpack release)
